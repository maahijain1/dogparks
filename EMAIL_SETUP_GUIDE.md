# 📧 Email Notifications Setup Guide

## Overview
I've set up email notifications for your "Get Featured" form. When someone submits the form, you'll receive an email notification with all their details, and they'll get a confirmation email.

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ **Email Service Integration**
- **Resend Email Service**: Professional email delivery
- **Admin Notifications**: You receive detailed emails about new applications
- **Customer Confirmations**: Business owners get confirmation emails
- **Professional Templates**: Beautiful HTML email templates

### ✅ **Email Features**
- **Rich HTML Templates**: Professional-looking emails with your branding
- **Complete Business Info**: All form details included in admin emails
- **Application ID**: Unique tracking for each submission
- **Next Steps Guide**: Clear instructions for processing applications
- **Admin Panel Link**: Direct link to your admin dashboard

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Get Resend API Key**
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free)
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Optional: Custom domain (if you have one)
# RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### **Step 3: Update Email Addresses**
In `src/lib/email.ts`, update these lines:
- Line 12: `from: 'DirectoryHub <noreply@directoryhub.com>'` → Your domain
- Line 13: `to: [process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL || 'admin@directoryhub.com']` → Your email
- Line 15: `subject: '🌟 New Featured Listing Application - ${application.businessName}'`

## 📧 Email Templates

### **Admin Notification Email**
- **Subject**: "🌟 New Featured Listing Application - [Business Name]"
- **Content**: Complete business details, contact info, location, description
- **Features**: Professional layout, application ID, next steps guide
- **Action**: Direct link to admin panel

### **Customer Confirmation Email**
- **Subject**: "Thank you for your featured listing application - [Business Name]"
- **Content**: Application confirmation, pricing info, next steps
- **Features**: Professional branding, clear expectations

## 💰 Pricing Information in Emails
- **Special Offer**: $9/month for first 3 months
- **Regular Rate**: $19/month after initial period
- **Clear Benefits**: Featured placement, priority support

## 🔄 How It Works

### **When Someone Submits the Form:**
1. **Form Submission** → Data sent to `/api/featured-listing`
2. **Admin Email** → You receive detailed notification
3. **Customer Email** → They receive confirmation
4. **Application ID** → Unique tracking number generated
5. **Console Log** → Also logged for backup

### **Your Workflow:**
1. **Check Email** → Receive notification with all details
2. **Review Application** → Check business information
3. **Contact Business** → Call/email to discuss payment
4. **Set Up Payment** → Send Stripe/PayPal link
5. **Activate Listing** → Mark as featured in admin panel

## 🛠️ Testing

### **Test the Email System:**
1. Fill out the "Get Featured" form on your website
2. Check your email for the admin notification
3. Check the business owner's email for confirmation
4. Verify all information is correct

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **No emails received**: Check RESEND_API_KEY in .env.local
- **Wrong email address**: Update ADMIN_EMAIL in .env.local
- **Email formatting issues**: Check console logs for errors

## 📊 Email Analytics
- **Resend Dashboard**: Track email delivery, opens, clicks
- **Free Tier**: 100 emails/day, 3,000 emails/month
- **Paid Plans**: Available if you need more volume

## 🔒 Security Notes
- **API Keys**: Keep RESEND_API_KEY secure
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit .env.local to git
- **Email Validation**: Form validates required fields
- **Rate Limiting**: Resend handles rate limiting automatically

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Set up Resend account and get API key
2. Add environment variables to .env.local
3. Test the email system
4. Consider setting up a custom domain for emails
5. Set up payment processing (Stripe/PayPal) for actual transactions

Your email notification system is now ready! 🚀
